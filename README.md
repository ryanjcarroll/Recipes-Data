# Recipes-Data
Data analysis project on top recipes, web scraped from allrecipes.com

To view analysis, run the 'Recipe Data Analysis' notebook.  To skip straight to the figures, open the 'figures' folder and view the image files.

Recipe data is saved in the file 'recipes.json'.  To scrape additional data, run the 'Web Scraper' notebook, setting the first_page and last_page parameters to specify the range of pages to scrape.
